Answer The Following Questions:

Titanic Dataset:
1. Is a single DT prone to over-fitting with the Titanic dataset?

   Yes

2. How does classification accuracy behave as a function of the number of trees?

   The accuracy goes up as the number of trees goes up. The accuracy is more
   greatly improved when the number is small (e.g. from 1 to 10) than when the
   number is big (e.g from 90 to 100).

3. Do you think the random forest was helpful?  Explain.

   Yes, because it increases the accuracy and lowers the error caused by
   overfitting of the training data of a single tree.

Amazon Dataset:
1. What is the highest accuracy you are able to achieve? Do you think you can reach an even higher
   accuracy with just random forests?

   50.6. I would like to say yes. However, if the number of trees is big enough (e.g. 1000),
   the increase of this number will only improve the accuracy to a very little extent. (e.g. increase
   in thousandths)

2. Can you think of a better way to choose split functions as opposed to the method in _find_split?

   We can choose a specific dimension instead of choosing it randomly. For example, choose the
   dimension with the least unique values.

3. How does this challenge differ from that with the Titanic dataset?

   This challenge has multiple classes to be classified while the Titanic dataset has binary
   classes. In addition, the amazon challenge is high-dimensional and has much more features to be
   split. The training set provided is relatively small to the dataset while the titanic training set
   has a proper size.
